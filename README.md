Antineoplastics are too old school. They might be efficient, but, in the end, we just intoxicate our patients by giving them a poison that even our own personal needs a Class II B Biological Cabinet and two disposable gloves in order to manipulate it safely, all this while praying that it'll work without any resistant-type of neoplasmic cell appearing.
Not only that, but the treatment is also too costly and its efficiency drops too much when there are metastasis involved.

It's necessary to develop an alternative way of treating cancer and, if possible, other treacherous diseases like AIDS, all of this while having a more certainty and control over the situation.
That's why the idea here is to use AI-moved nanobots whose work will be supervised by a professional. All of this to treat diseases, without making the process too costly for the patient.

The nanobots must be able to be powered thorugh a less toxic way of energy as possible. The ideal would be using the chemical energy from the organism(ions dissolved in blood, like Ca+² and Na+ or Phospate bonds in ATP, ADP, AMP...). However, that might be a bit difficult for now, so an alternative would be X-Rays, or some kind of eletromagnetic waves that can penetrate the skin and generate eletric current in the nanobots through photoeletric effect.

The energy could be sent through eletromagnetic waves directly into some specific metals in the nanobots circuits. Ideally, such circuits could be nano(or pico?)chips. Yet, this may be a bit too difficult for now. **An alternative could be using electron transporter chains extracted from mitochondres inner membranes** . An electron transporter chain works in a manner that resembles a battery, in a cascate of redox reactions, from the first complex (which has the highest oxidation potential, or the lowest reduction potential) passing by the third complex (the second may be ignored as it's just another entrance for electrons, through succinate-dehydrogenasis) to the fourth complex (which has the highest reduction potential).
In the mitochondre, the movement of electrons is used to change the shape of channel proteins and promote passage of prótons(H+ íons). Maybe we could try adapting this system to work as a bioelectrical circuit for micro or nano-scaled machines.

They also must be able to distinguish friend from foe. For that, an AI can be quite convenient, and this is where Diana must shine. She must be able to get images (through light or sound) - probably through sound, as a way of mapping each cell interior(getting the shape of the nucleus, for example) - from each single nanomachine in the swarm and classify the cells she's seeing as target or non-target. Target cells must be eliminated.
The elimination perhaps can occur through simple physical damage directly to the nucleus. One must pay attention to the possibility of inducing necrosis into nearby cells. This is why Diana must also have a Reinforcement Learning option... *and a shut down button, in case she goes berserk*. Just kidding, but still.

Another question to be analysed is the aspect of Internet of Things: the nanobots must be able to get signals and send them to a computer, where the AI will actually be acting, and receive signals back from the computer. Again, the signals probably must have high frequency and low wavelength in order to get past the human body without suffering big distortions. X-rays might, again, be a good alternative, but this once again limits the organs and patients that can receive this procedure.


Let the nanomachines hunt begin, son.

*Yes, I might be too much into science fiction...but isn't it imagination the first step to creation?*

## Vision

A nanomachine would probably be like a submarine in a cellular scale. As such, its vision could work in the same way as a submarine: through ultrasounds.
Adapting UNet in order to use ultrasound images might be interesting for this. Alas, it still isn't possible to use ultrasound in a cellular scale in order to detect changes inside a cell withouth damaging it(ultrasound might, even, cause cellular damage, being used as a mechanism to extract DNA in biotech field).
Unfortunately, the problem here is probably developing a equipment able to launch and detect ultrasound or another waves that will have a wavelength as small as a cell(micrometers). If such equipment exists, it wouldn't be hard to pass the detected wavelengths to a Neural Network. Simply multipling values might be enough.

While we don't have such equipment, we could rely on spectrometry: assuming that we can mark a pathological cell DNA in a way that it shines, the nanomachines could be able to detect those cells in a way that the immune system can't.
We could train our model with immunospectrometry, since the idea is the same: detect cells whose DNA glows(of cells with glowing points) and destroy them. When in practice, we could simply use some way to mark a specific cell that possess a specific, pathologic genetic sequence(ex: a tumor, which has, as remarkable trait, the replacement of certain bases CCCGCC ---> TTTGCC), through radioactive isotropes. This treatment might be specifically efficient to tumorous cells, since they're constantly in mithosis, thus, constantly incorporating mollecules to its DNA.

## Adhesion

In order to properly perform its work, such submarine would require to move through the blood flow and, when getting close/detecting an pathological element, would have to fix itself to some surface or even to the pathogen itself. A possibility for this would be using cadherins, a biomolecule used by cells to attach themselves to each other. It would be interesting to take a look at macrophages and neutrophils cadherins, since they're able to attach to any cell(and even to non-biological components, like India Ink and dust particles).

## Deletion

The most obvious way to remove a pathological cell from the body would be simply destroying it through cellular damage. This could be made through nanoscopic scalpels or through other mechanisms, such as applying ethanol 100% or ultrasound. However, doing so could release mollecules that could induce apoptosis in neighbour cells.
Maybe the most clean and smooth way of doing so would be through injection of Ca²+ íons(which activate many enzymes chain, including caspase cascate), injection of BAK/BAX channels(to promote liberation of p53 cytochromes from mitochondres), or even injection of a mixture of p53 and Ca²+, or even apoptossomes that are already activated with Ca²+ íons. Beware of possible inhibitors of caspases that tumoral cells could develop.

## Extraction

The ideal for making such nanomachines would be using biological composites, that could be degraded by the body, such as proteins and lipids. However, if this were possible, it could also make the process more expensive, as the nanomachine would be lost after each operation.
So, an alternative would be making it from a sterile material that wouldn't trigger an immune response. After the operation is done, the nanomachine could go to a part of the body where it could be easily extracted, such as the forearm. There, it could induce an inflammation by damaging some healthy cells. The inflammation would increase blood flow through that part, making it easier for other nanomachines to get there and fix themselves. Inducing the formation of pustules could also help during this process.

After all it's done, the nanomachine could be extracted from the biological material, cleaned up and used again. If it's the same size as a cell, it would have little room for being contaminated, right?
