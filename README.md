Antineoplastics are too old school. They might be efficient, but, in the end, we just intoxicate our patients by giving them a poison that even our own personal needs a Class II B Biological Cabinet and two disposable gloves in order to manipulate it safely, all this while praying that it'll work without any resistant-type of neoplasmic cell appearing.
Not only that, but the treatment is also too costly and its efficiency drops too much when there are metastasis involved.

It's necessary to develop an alternative way of treating cancer and, if possible, other treacherous diseases like AIDS, all of this while having a more certainty and control over the situation.
That's why the idea here is to use AI-moved nanobots whose work will be supervised by a professional. All of this to treat diseases, without making the process too costly for the patient.

The nanobots must be able to be powered thorugh a less toxic way of energy as possible. The ideal would be using the chemical energy from the organism(ions dissolved in blood, like Ca+Â² and Na+ or Phospate bonds in ATP, ADP, AMP...). However, that might be a bit difficult for now, so an alternative would be X-Rays, or some kind of eletromagnetic waves that can penetrate the skin and generate eletric current in the nanobots through photoeletric effect.
They also must be able to distinguish friend from foe. For that, an AI can be quite convenient, and this is where Diana must shine. She must be able to get images (through light or sound) from each single nanomachine in the swarm and classify the cells she's seeing as target or non-target. Target cells must be eliminated.
The elimination perhaps can occur through simple physical damage directly to the nucleus. One must pay attention to the possibility of inducing necrosis into nearby cells. This is why Diana must also have a Reinforcement Learning option... *and a shut down button, in case she goes berserk*. Just kidding, but still.


Let the nanomachines hunt begin, son.

*Yes, I might be too much into science fiction...but isn't it imagination the first step to creation?*
